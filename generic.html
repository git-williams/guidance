								<h3>The Past</h3>
<p>Despite the way I was raised, I had grown up weak, selfish, unkind, dishonest, lazy, prideful, arrogant, un-athletic, and honestly quite unattractive. The only thing I had going for me was that I was pretty smart, and was capable of shit-talking and people-pleasing my way to the top of my social ranks. All along, I had full capability to make myself a better person, but I didn't. My pride did not allow me to see my own flaws. And so, for most of my comparatively short life, I've done nothing but waste my time. I've chased the social approval, the immediate gratification, and avoided the uncomfortable at all costs. I made excuses for nearly everything I did, telling myself I was doing it right so I didn’t have to face the real guilt of my choices.</p>
								
<p>Maybe it was just growing up, or maybe I grew tired of living in a mind full of conflict, broken promises, and "I'll do it tomorrow's". Either way, eventually, I realized that I was falling behind. I was not the person I wanted to be, nor was I on the path to become that person. And so, I stopped making excuses. It started in the gym, where I would catch myself skipping out on reps. That translated to other parts of my life, where I began to notice my laziness, lack of discipline, and resentment for the past in an increasing amount. I started to see things clearly, for what they really were. </p>

								<h4>The Future</h4>
<p>It feels like my real journey has just barely started. Yes, I’ve been chasing sexy muscles and those super sick leg veins for a while now, but at this point in my life, I’m after something much greater. My body is changing, but my mind is falling behind. I still find myself shrouded in temptations, laziness, and selfishness, as if I were a complete beginner. I realize now that not only does my body have to be in excellent shape, but so does my mind. My aim for this year is to grow as a person, in every way. I’m correcting the path I’ve been on, and I’m relieving myself of the carnal habits embedded into me. Day after day, I am working towards becoming less selfish, unforgiving, undisciplined, impatient, and unkind. Basic stuff, I know, but of extreme importance. </p>
								
<p>Mental thresholds aren't the only ones I'm going to break this year. I'm going to surpass my limits in all areas. I'm getting faster, more athletic, and stronger through my training. I'm learning balance, calisthenics strength, and physical fortitude. I'm expanding my creative abilities by learning French, playing piano, and practicing my drawing & painting skills. I also write, for an audience, (you) and for myself. I’m an aspiring artist, writer, and creator. On top of those personal improvements, I plan to make money. My goal for this year is $10,000, but what's more important to me is that I build an engaged community that is interested in learning and growing in knowledge. To do that, I'm going to learn as much as I possibly can about the mind, body, and spirit, and then apply it to my life while sharing what I learn. </p>

								<h4>Thank you</h4>
								<p>So, welcome to <i>Guidance</i>! Thank you for reading, if you want to know more about me, I've plastered my X (Twitter) account all over this website, I'd be happy to answer some specific questions. Just no questions about social security numbers or addresses, thanks.</p>
