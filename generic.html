								<h3>The Past</h3>
								<p>I was born with absolutely 0 talent. Despite the way I was raised, I had grown up weak, selfish, unkind, dishonest, lazy, prideful, arrogant, un-athletic, and honestly quite unattractive. The only thing I had going for me was that I was pretty smart, and was capable of shit-talking and people-pleasing my way to the top of my social ranks. All along, I had full capability to make myself a better person, but I didn't. My pride did not allow me to see my own flaws. So, for much of my comparatively short life, I've wasted my time. I've chased the social approval, the immediate gratification, and avoided the uncomfortable at all costs. I made excuses for nearly every thing I did. </p>

								<p>Maybe it was just growing up, or maybe it was being tired of living in a mind full of conflict, broken promises, and i'll do it tomorrow's. Either way, eventually, I realized that I was falling behind. I was not the person I wanted to be, nor was I on the path to become that person. And so, I made a few changes here and there. I held my tongue once or twice, or showed some abstinence other times. But nothing ever stuck for me. I was still just floating through my life, pretending I was doing it right. It started off with me wanting muscles. Day after day, I would guilt trip myself into the gym. Eventually, that fabricated consistency turned into something real. Discipline. Going to the gym became second nature. I realized change really was possible. I really did change myself. That realization transformed me. I started to workshop everything. I shifted my focus from pleasure and comfort to change and purpose.  </p>
