								<h3>The Past</h3>
								<p>I was not a good person. I was weak, selfish, impatient, un-athletic, hateful, vengeful, arrogant, prideful, honestly pretty unattractive, and the list goes on. My main problem was that I was so full of myself I wouldn’t even acknowledge my very real issues as reality. I was constantly fighting with my family. I was angry at the world. I had no creative passions. I was involved in ‘drama’ at school. I didn’t have peace. I wanted conflict. I was lost. I wasn’t doing anything, I wasn’t going anywhere, and I didn’t have anything going for me. My life was based on entertainment, comfort, pleasure, and pride. All along, I had full capability to change myself, but I didn’t. My pride would not allow me to see my flaws. And so, for most of my comparatively short life, I've done nothing but waste my time. I've chased the social approval, the immediate gratification, and avoided the uncomfortable at all costs. I replaced the beauty of life with negativity and selfishness. I made excuses for nearly everything I did, telling myself <i>I</i> was doing it right so I didn’t have to face the reality of my choices.</p>
<hr />

								<h4>The Future</h4>
								<p>However, as you can see by the big bold headlines here, that was the past. And, somewhere down the line, I realized it was time to change. I’m lucky I got to it early, but others aren’t so fortunate. And, honestly, that’s my ‘main goal’ for the future. It’s plastered everywhere, but the main goal for my online presence is to inspire change out of nothing. To create it out of thin air, just like I did. Change is simple to execute, but it’s not easy to, and it’s even harder to know <i>what</i> to change or <i>why</i>. I’m here to share my secrets with you, in hopes to make your personal journey just <i>that much easier.</i> Of course, I have fitness goals too, like a 225 bench or a full planche, and physical goals like 1,000 followers or $10,000. But none of those goals are more important than my intellectual, mental, and creative journeys. I’m on a constant journey to growth, and I’m here to share my little piece of the world with you. </p>

								<h4>Thank you</h4>
<p>So, welcome to <i>Guidance</i>! Thank you for reading. If you’d like to know more about me, reach out to me on one of my socials and I'd be happy to talk to one of you. Any of you. Seriously. It’s like I’m stranded on Mars out here. Human contact is greatly appreciated. Just no questions about social security numbers or addresses, thanks.</p>
