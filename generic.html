								<h3>The Past</h3>
								<p>I was born with absolutely 0 talent. Despite the way I was raised, I had grown up weak, selfish, unkind, dishonest, lazy, prideful, arrogant, un-athletic, and honestly quite unattractive. The only thing I had going for me was that I was pretty smart, and was capable of shit-talking and people-pleasing my way to the top of my social ranks. All along, I had full capability to make myself a better person, but I didn't. My pride did not allow me to see my own flaws. So, for most of my comparatively short life, I've just wasted my time. I've chased the social approval, the immediate gratification, and avoided the uncomfortable at all costs. I made excuses for nearly every thing I did. </p>

								<p>Maybe it was just growing up, or maybe it was being tired of living in a mind full of conflict, broken promises, and i'll do it tomorrow's. Either way, eventually, I realized that I was falling behind. I was not the person I wanted to be, nor was I on the path to become that person. And so, I made a few changes here and there. I held my tongue once or twice, or showed some abstinence other times. But nothing ever stuck for me. I was still just floating through my life, pretending I was doing it right. It started off with me wanting muscles. Day after day, I would guilt trip myself into the gym. Eventually, that fabricated consistency turned into something real. Discipline. Going to the gym became second nature. I realized change really was possible. I really did change myself. That realization transformed me. I started to workshop everything. I shifted my focus from pleasure and comfort to change and purpose.  </p>

								<h4>The Future</h4>
								<p>It feels like my real journey has just barely started. Yes, I've been working towards sexy muscles and those super sick leg veins for a while now. But now, I'm after something much greater than that. I want to live a beautiful life as a beautiful person. I'm not just talking about looks, I want to <i>be</i> better. My body is changing, but my mind is falling behind. I still find myself shrouded in temptations, laziness, and selfishness. So, my aim for this year is to get my mind right, and fix those carnal habits embedded into me. I want to be kinder, more patient, more disciplined, and more forgiving. I'm chasing improvement, not perfection. And I'm learning a lot along the way.</p>

								<p>Mental thresholds aren't the only ones I'm going to break this year. I'm going to surpass my limits on all areas. I'm getting faster, more athletic, and stronger through hours of hard work. I'm learning balance, calisthenics strength, and physical fortitude. I'm expanding my creative abilities, by learning french, playing piano, and practicing my drawing & painting skills. Those are just side activities though, usually for relaxation at the end of the day. On top of those personal improvements, I plan to make money. My goal for this year is $10,000, but what's more important to be is that I build an engaged community, that is interested in learning from my journey. To do that, I'm going to learn as much as I possibly can about the mind, body, and spirit, and then I'll apply it to my life while sharing what I learn. I promise, we can help each other. </p>
