								<h2>Why should you read?<br />
								</h2>
								<p>My goal for<i> The Redirection</i> is to deliver one message per week that will<br />
								<i> 'redirect'</i> your focus to the right areas, inspiring personal change.<br/ >
								<br />
									Most newsletters are about one topic only. Politics, fitness, health, or maybe even something important like Family Guy conspiracy theories. However, I believe I've found the most important newsletter topic of them all. Change. People give you all the information in the world—the best exercises to do, the best books to read, or the best habits to learn. But, they don't give you the value. They don't give you the direction or meaning behind any of it. They don't explain how it correlates to genuine, authentic change. <br />
								<br />
									That's where I come in. I give you the information, and then I tell you exactly what you should be doing with it. You may be surprised, it's never as obvious as it seems. Don't worry, I won't be covering the same basic, saturated topics all the other 10,000,000 self-improvement guys are. Everything I give you will connect on a deeper level. You'll have no choice but to incorporate the knowlegde I share into your life, because it's <i>that</i> good.<br/ >
								<br />
									If you're feeling lost—on anything, a 5 minute read can give you some direction.
